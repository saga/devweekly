https://github.com/joelhans/bmo-agent/ A self-improving AI coding agent that runs in your terminal. bmo uses LLM-powered tool execution to complete tasks, and autonomously builds new tools and skills when it encounters limitations. It features multi-provider LLM routing, sandboxed tool execution, session persistence with cost tracking, and a self-improvement loop driven by reflections and periodic maintenance.

https://github.com/dungle-scrubs/tallow Tallow is a terminal coding agent that starts minimal and scales up. Install only the extensions, themes, and agents your project needs, or enable everything. It drops into existing Claude Code projects via .claude/ bridging, so nothing breaks when you switch. Ships with 51 extensions, 34 themes, and 10 specialized agents.

```

https://github.com/jo-inc/pi-reflect Self-improving behavioral files for pi coding agents. Analyzes session transcripts for correction patterns and makes surgical edits to prevent recurrence.

```typescript
	pi.on("session_start", async (_event, ctx) => {
		modelRegistryRef = ctx.modelRegistry;
	});
	pi.registerCommand("reflect", {
		description: "Reflect on recent sessions and improve a behavioral markdown file",
		handler: async (args, ctx) => {
			modelRegistryRef = ctx.modelRegistry;
			const targetPath = args?.trim();
```

https://github.com/nicobailon/pi-model-switch A Pi coding agent extension that gives the agent the ability to list, search, and switch models on its own. With this extension, you can tell the agent things like "switch to a cheaper model" or "use Claude for this task" and it will handle the model change itself, without you needing to use /model or keyboard shortcuts.

https://github.com/vamsi/pi Port of pi-mono to Python; AI agent toolkit: coding agent CLI, unified LLM API, TUI & web UI libraries, Slack bot, vLLM pod.
